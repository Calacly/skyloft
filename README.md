# Skyloft
>Landing Page for a climbing park

`Skyloft` was one of many small projects for my apprenticeship in digital media design and development. Due to time constraints and the focus being on the animation of the landing page, it has not been made fully responsive. I have the intention of changing this when time allows :)

# Purpose
* Provide a unique and enticing landing page which will compel the user to go below the fold.

# Necessary Improvements
* Make fully responsive and test for cross-browser compatibility
* Improve site loading performance by further optimizing images (webp, picture element, etc.)
